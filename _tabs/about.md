I'm a Solution Architect based in Brisbane, Australia, specializing in cloud-native and hybrid infrastructure solutions. With experience across public and private sectors, I help organizations navigate complex technology landscapes and design scalable, resilient systems.

## Expertise

- Leading cloud transformations, modernizing applications with cloud-native architectures, and establishing robust governance frameworks.
  
- Provide technical leadership to teams, especially in maturing their DevSecOps practices, and encourage everynoe to build security into every deliverable using modern tools like Cloudflare, Entra ID, GitHub Security, and the Microsoft Defender suite.
- Implementing modern workplace transformations with tools like Intune, Autopilot, Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365.

## Approach
I mainly hold Microsoft certifications, but I always maintain a cloud-agnostic approach, focusing on selecting the right tools and platforms for each unique objective. I guide cross-functional IT teams in adopting cloud-native solutions and processes, to achieve the best user experience and operational excellence.
