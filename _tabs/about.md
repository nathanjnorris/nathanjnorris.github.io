I'm a Solution Architect based in Australia, with work experience in Canada and New Zealand, specializing in cloud-native and hybrid infrastructure solutions. I've helped public and private sector organisations navigate complex technology landscapes to design and operate scalable, resilient, and secure systems.

## Expertise

- Leading cloud transformations, modernizing applications with cloud-native architectures, and establishing robust governance frameworks.
- Providing technical leadership to IT teams, especially in maturing their DevSecOps practices, and encouraging teams to build security into every deliverable using modern tools like Cloudflare, Entra ID, GitHub Security, and the Microsoft Defender suite.
- Implementing modern workplace transformations with tools like Intune, Autopilot, Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365.

## Approach
I mainly hold Microsoft certifications, but I always maintain a cloud-agnostic approach, focusing on selecting the right tools and platforms for each unique objective. I lead organisations in adopting cloud-native solutions and processes, to achieve the desired business outcomes, the best user experience, and operational excellence.
